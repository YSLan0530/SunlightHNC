## General purpose HNC code

The current stable release is version 1.7

Version 1.7 handles an arbitrary number of components (rather than a
maximum of three, as for previous versions).

The present development snapshot incorporates the exact and
approximate pair potentials for Slater charge smearing, adds plots
to the demo scripts which compare with published data for various
systems, and now includes the MSA closure for hard core potentials (not fully tested).

#### Features

* FORTRAN 90 based, with example python driver scripts ;
* fast Ng solver, and Ng decomposition for electrostatics ;
* multicomponent (arbitrary number of components) ;
* hard and soft core (DPD) potentials ;
* full structural thermodynamics ;
* fully open source.

See [PDF documentation](oz_doc.pdf "oz_doc.pdf") for details.

#### Installation Notes

The main code is written as a FORTRAN 90 module, and can be compiled
using `gfortran` from the [GNU compiler
collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/ "GNU website").  A basic Makefile is
provided.  The code is designed to be run from python using the `f2py`
interface from [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/ "SciPy website"), though
some examples of 'vanilla' FORTRAN 90 driver codes are included.  The
default target in the `Makefile` builds the required files for the
`f2py` interface.

The [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/ "LAPACK webpage")
linear algebra library and [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/ "FFTW website")
fast Fourier transform library are both required.

The compiler tools including `f2py`, and pre-built versions of the
`lapack` and `fftw` libraries, are available for most modern GNU/Linux
distributions.
